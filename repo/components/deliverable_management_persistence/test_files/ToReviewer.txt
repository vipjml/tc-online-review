Dear reviewer

Please note that this component requires Deliverable Managment
in version 1.2, you will find the implementation in 
test_files\deliverable_management.jar directory.

To run the test you will need to set up the database:

#1 First use the ddl script in the dbschema.sql
(it includes submission_type_lu table)

#2 Modify the dbfactory.xml with you database settings.

Then the tests should execute successfully.

Have a nice day.

Here is what I have done.

1. some logging messages in the old methods are incorrect, they are being corrected, like loadUploads(long[]).
2. useless cast is removed since generic is used, like (Submission[]) submissions.toArray(new Submission[submissions.size()]);
3. logging and parameter check order is corrected.
4. Helper class is refactored.
5. please check each class doc for concrete changes.
