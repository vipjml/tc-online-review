This readme file explains how to setup and build this component.
(See: http://www.topcoder.com/wiki/display/tc/Java+Component+Build+Process for an explanation of the build process used.)

1. Install the component structure in ${basedir}

2. Create "topcoder_global.properties" in ${basedir}/.. and add the properties from steps 2,3,4,5

3. The following standard build script properties must be set
    ext_libdir - root of third party libraries
    tcs_libdir - root of topcoder components
    java_1_3_bootclasspath - installation path for java 1.3 (only needed for compile_targets task)
    junit.jar - location of junit.jar (component was written for v3.8.2)

4. The following standard build script properties can be changed (defaults are noted)
    debug=off - as expected
    verbose=no - as expected
    cobertura.dir=${ext_libdir}/cobertura/1.8
        installation directory of cobertura script expects {$cobertura.dir}/cobertura.jar
        and {$cobertura.dir}/lib/containg Jars for asm, jakarta, and log4j to run cobertura task

5. The following third party libraries need to have their location specified - by default the build-dependencies.xml file looks for these under ${ext_libdir}, if you follow the setup listed in that file, you will not need to add these to global:
    ${log4j.jar} - version 1.2.9 or later
    ${javamail.jar} - version 1.3.2 or later
    ${jaf.jar} - version 1.0.2 or later

6. Ant Commands:
    ant clean - removes temporary build files
    ant compile - builds the production code
    ant compile_tests - builds the test code
    ant test - runs the test code
    ant reports-all - generates javadoc and code coverage reports
    ant deploy-lib - moves the component runtime jar to the location where other components will look for it.
