 * An Ajax request handler's "service" method will take an AjaxRequest,

 * that user and produce the corresponding AjaxResponse object.<br><br>
 *
 * A successful servicing operation must return an AjaxResponse object with the "success" status,
 * and optionally the result data.<br><br>
 *
 * Any servicing error must be returned as an AjaxResponse object with an error specific status,
 * and optionally the error message or data.<br><br>
 *
 * Any successful or failed operation is must be logged
 * by the implementation classes using the Logging Wrapper component.
