Online Review Login Demo README:

1. JBoss should be used to run this demo.
   Otherwise, you may need to change some configurations.
   For JBoss, you can simply copy this folder to deploy directory.

2. Take care of the files under WEB-INF/classes.
   They are configuration files for ConfigManager.

3. In order to keep the submission small, 
   all the jars under WEB-INF\lib are removed.
   You should put them back to this folder,
   or configure WEB-INF/web.xml to let them in CLASSPATH.
   Here is a list of their names:

-- Third party packages.
-- All of them can be found in struts or jboss distributions.
