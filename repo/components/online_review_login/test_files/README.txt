1. All the jar path should be configured correctly. For your convenience, I put them all in test_reflib
  
2. Testing:
   a) StrutsTestCase: http://strutstestcase.sourceforge.net
   b) spring mock is used to test AuthCookieManagerImpl. You can get it from the spring libs
   b) JBoss: http://www.jboss.org
   c) MySQL
   d) Please read test_files/test.prepare/README.txt to configure them.

3. Demo:
   a) JBoss should be used
   b) Please read test_files/demoapp.war/README.txt to configure them.

NOTE: test_files/tcsUtil.jar is a package which cann't be downloaded from TC website.
      But it is necessary for compile and test.

-- Thank you!
