/**
 * This is the main contract for object validation. Here we have the ability for
 * simple validation (true/false) which will tell us if the object input
 * is valid or not. We also have the ability to specify a validation that will
 * produce a message if the valiadation fails telling us something about the
 * cause. For complex validation where we could have multiple failure points
 * we have the ability to fetch all the messages that come from the validators
 * that failed the object. This can further be refined into a short-circuited
 * evaluation or the non-short-circuted evaluation.
 * In short-circuited evaluation we have a scenario where the validator will
 * return a failed result (with associated) messages, the moment it can
 * determine that the validation has failed. For example and AndValidator need
 * only fail the first of its constituent validators to know that the whole
 * validation fails. Thus there is no need to invoke any further validators in
 * the tree. Thus we have short-circuited AndValidators for failure. The same
 * way the OrValidator is short-circuited for success.
 * In non-short-circuted evaluation we keep on traversing the validator tree
 * regardless of the fact that the composite outcome is already determined.
 * This is good for situations where we woudl like to return to the user as
 * much as possible information so that they can correct the issues as in
 * a web page input for example. There is also a variation on this with being
 * able to limit the numbner of messages that are returned to the caller
 * so as to put an upper limit on the validator tree traversal.
 * Implementations of this are required to be thread-safe.
