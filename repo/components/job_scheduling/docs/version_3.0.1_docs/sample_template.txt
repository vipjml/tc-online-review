# This is a sample template.
#
# - A comment line starts with #.
# - If # is needed at the start of a line, then \# should be used.
# - The character # can be used freely after the start of the line without applying the previous rule.
# - The template fields have the syntax %fieldname=defaultValue{description}% where =defaultvalue is optional
# - If %, {, =, \ are needed as actual text then \%, \{, \=, \\ should be used instead (similar to \ in Java).
# - Looping constructs can be done using the loop special field.
# - Everything between %loop:field_name% and %endloop% will be repeated as many times as
# the field_name appears in the input XML.
# - Loops can be nested.
Hi,
This email notifies you that the job %JobName% has the status %JobStatus% now.
