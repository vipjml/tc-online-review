 * <p>
 * The ScheduledEnable interface is the only required interface for classes run as a job in Job
 * Scheduler 2.0. It extends Schedulable interface(v1.0) and Runnable interface, And forces the
 * implementation classes return running status and message data at runtime.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: The classes only implementing Schedulable and Runnable interfaces can run in version 2.0.
 * But they can't use the additional functions provided by version 2.0.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Thread safety : the implementations of ScheduledEnable should be thread-safe, that means when
 * the job is running, the isDone, getRunningStatus, etc methods can be called in thread-safe way.
