	flexunitantdir - the directory of FlexUnit Ant Task
	asdocantdir - the directory of AsDoc Ant Task

4. Ant Commands:
	ant clean - removes temporary build files
	ant compile - builds the production code
	ant compile_tests - builds the test code
	ant test - runs the test code
	ant asdoc - generates asdoc for this component
