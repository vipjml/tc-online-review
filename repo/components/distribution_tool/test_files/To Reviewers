Hi reviewers, thank you for your work. The following is some notes for you.

1. There is design change, now we are required to use jodconverter to do
the pdf convertion, all the jars needed are attached in /test_reflib

2. From the 'README' of jodconverter-2.2.2:
"Before you can perform any conversions you need to start OpenOffice.org
in listening mode on port 8100 as described in the JODConverter Guide.

As a quick start you can type from a command line

  soffice -headless -accept="socket,port=8100;urp;"

I also provide you a shell script for this, you can just start the script
before running test cases. It's /test_files/startOpenOfficeConn.sh

3. As the scope of this component is a little complicate, I have tried my
best to test it fully, and make the coverage up to 90%+ (92%,98%), please consider
my effort for this when scoring my submission

4. Due to the design change, we have to test this component under linux, so
I didn't test creating .net distribution as no MSBuild command supported.
However, I still have a test case for the generated dir structures of .net
componnet (only comment the last command in the script.txt for .net)
The commented command:
# execute        : MSBuild "Component Sources.csproj" /t:DesignDist :: %{comp_dir}

5. while executing the ant command to generate design_dist, there are some dependences
one is 'ant-contrib', ant-contrib-1.0b3.jar is provided in test_reflib/ for you,
you need to put in your ANT_HOME/lib, the is 'cobertura', you should make sure it can
be found.

6. Two functions exceed 30 statements (32, 35), however, it's not a big deal given the
complexity of this componnet.

7. Besides the tcs component dependencies listed in CS, there are also indirected referenced
tcs components 'object_formatter', 'typesafe_enum'. See my build-dependency.xml for details.

8. Thanks
