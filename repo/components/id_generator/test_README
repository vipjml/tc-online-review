1. Modify the "build.xml" to update the value of "junit", maybe you also need to configure the path for dependencies.
2. You should configure MySql, Oracle, SqlServer2005.
3. Then Modify
test_files\com\topcoder\db\connectionfactory\DBConnectionFactoryImpl.xml
test_files\fixtest\DBConnectionFactoryImpl.xml
according your database setting.
4. execute mysql.sql, mssql.sql, oracle.sql, accuracytests\run_me_first.sql
failure\failuretest_id_sequences.sql
NOTE: if you want to run test again, you should drop the id_sequences table and do step 4 again first.
