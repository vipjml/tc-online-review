Before running the tests, please be sure to properly prepare MySQL, MSSQL and ORACLE database servers.

The initialization scripts for these databases exist in the folder test_files (mysql.sql, mssql.sql and oracle.sql).

Note for MSSQL 2000, the jdbc driver has 3 jars: msbase.jar, msutil.jar and sqlserver.jar. All of them should be included in the classpath.
