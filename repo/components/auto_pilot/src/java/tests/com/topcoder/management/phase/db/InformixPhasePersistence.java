/**
 * <p>
 * This is an actual implementation of database persistence that is geared for Informix database.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Connection Handling 1. We get a new connection for each invoked method 2. We set autocommit to
 * false 3. We do the action (start a transaction as shown in CS in section 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 4. If we
 * have no issues we commit 5. If we have issues we rollback 6. Dispose of the connection
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Auditing Operator audit is based on simply filling in the create_user, create_date, modify_user,
 * and modify_date field for each create and update operation on any of the provided tables. When
 * creating we do the following steps: -Fill in the create_user and modify_user fields with
 * operator, and -Fill in the corresponding dates for the creation and modification time. When
 * updating we do the following steps: - Fill in modify_user fields with operator, and fill in the
 * corresponding date for modification time. Use current time stamp.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thread Safety InformixPhasePersistence acts like a stateless bean with utility-like functionality
 * where function calls retain no state from one call to the next. Separate connections are created
 * each time a call is made and thus (assuming the connections are different) there is no contention
 * for a connection from competing threads. This class is thread-safe.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Efficiency of operation We need to ensure that the actual operations are efficient. The biggest
 * issue with when dealing with fetching whole lists of records that can not be easily described
 * with a simple WHERE query. For example when fetching records for a list] of projects (based on
 * project ids) it is not sufficient to loop over the ids fetching each record (and its related
 * phases) in separate calls. Here is what should be done: The read operations should work like
 * this: SELECT ... FROM phase WHERE project_id IN (...) SELECT ... FROM phase_dependency JOIN phase
 * WHERE project_id IN (...) SELECT ... FROM phase_criteria JOIN phase WHERE project_id IN (...) The
 * Delete should work like DELETE FROM phase_criteria WHERE phase_id IN (...) DELETE FROM
 * phase_dependency WHERE dependency_phase_id IN (...) OR dependent_phase_id IN (...) DELETE FROM
 * phase WHERE phase_id IN (...) The idea is to use IN (list) to execute only a single JDBC call per
 * operation. for more information please refer to section 1.4.5 of the CS documentation
