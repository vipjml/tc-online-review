Compression Utility Component Design Change Log

Version 1.0 -> 2.0
 + Reformatted all existing diagrams to the current (2 / 2005) TopCoder
      standard; switched to Poseidon 2.x .zuml format in the process.
 + Expanded the existing use case diagram and renamed it to "Data Compression
      Use Cases"
 + Created new sequence diagrams for the new compression use cases, refactoring
      the existing sequences in the process and renaming them (to "Compress
      Data from Stream" and "Decompress Data From Stream").
 + Split the main class diagram into "Data Compression Class Diagram" and
      "LZ77Codec Class Diagram" to make the design easier to digest and to
      make it easier to depict the many relationships (especially to platform
      classes)
 + Removed constructor CompressionUtility(String, StringBuffer) from the class
      diagram.  Technically, this constructor was removed from the design
      during version 1.0 development, but the class diagram did not reflect it.
 + Removed all references to ExceptionInInitializerError.  This LinkageError
      subclass is thrown only in situations where generic LinkageError can
      also be thrown; it is not useful to distinguish for the purposes of the
      component design documents.
 + Added the DeflateCodec class as a replacement for DefaultCodec.
 + Deprecated DefaultCodec.
 + Added new use case diagram "File Archiving Use Cases"
 + Defined new interfaces Archiver, ArchiveCreator, and ArchiveExtractor for
      generic representation of archive file manipulation.
 + Defined new classes ZipArchiver, ZipCreator, and ZipExtractor implementing
      archive file manipulation for ZIP files.
 + Defined new class ArchiveUtility to function as a Facade for archive
      manipulation activities.
 + Created sequence diagrams for the file archiving use cases.
 + Created updated component specification for version 2.0.
